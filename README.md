### I don't like LinkedIn

##Tesseract
This program manually interacts with a half screen page of LinkedIn using Pytesseract, pyautogui, and computer vision to see what is currently on the screen. This method is purely experimental and just for me to learn how to emulate mouse and keystrokes.

##Selenium
This program is a more practical solution, using the HTML code of a website to interact with it rather than emulating mouse movements and keystrokes.
